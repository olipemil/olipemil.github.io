## COGITO Crystal Bonding Visualization

This interactive visualization demonstrates how the Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO) framework reveals the orbital-resolved covalent bonds and charge transfer encoded in Kohn-Sham wavefunctions from density functional theory calculations.
