Ph.D. Materials Science and Engineering and Scientific Computing at University of Michigan;
B.S. Physics at Idaho State University

I am a postdoc working at MIT with Prof. Tess Smidt and Prof. Jeffery Grossman to build better representations of quantum materials data. This increases our chemical understanding of materials properties while improving machine learning architectures for simplified training.

My scientific interests center around decoding complicated quantum simulations into chemically intuition frameworks to reveal the covalent, ionic, and metallic bonds which conspire to shape in material properties.

During my PhD, I creating the toolkit Crystal Orbital Guided Iteration To atomic-Orbitals (COGITO). 
This combined the devleopment of novel algorithms to parse DFT wavefunctions into an adaptable, maximally unique atomic basis with a powerful user inferface to visualization bonding and charge transfer in crystals. 
For more information, check out the [COGITO website](https://olipemil.github.io/cogito-website/) or the [COGITO paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19725). 
COGITO was created in the [Sun group](https://whsunresearch.group/) and [Kioupakis group](https://kioupakisgroup.engin.umich.edu/) at University of Michigan.
